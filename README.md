# Versioning
The version is broken down into 4 points e.g 1.2.3.4 We use MAJOR.MINOR.FEATURE.PATCH to describe the version numbers.

A MAJOR is very rare, it would only be considered if the source was effectively re-written or a clean break was desired for other reasons. This increment would likely break most 3rd party modules.

A MINOR is when there are significant changes that affect core structures. This increment would likely break some 3rd party modules.

A FEATURE version is when new extensions or features are added (such as a payment gateway, shipping module etc). Updating a feature version is at a low risk of breaking 3rd party modules.

A PATCH version is when a fix is added, it should be considered safe to update patch versions e.g 1.2.3.4 to 1.2.3.5
# Releases
OpenCart will announce to developers 1 week prior to public release of FEATURE versions, this is to allow for testing of their own modules for compatibility. For bigger releases (ones that contain many core changes, features and fixes) an extended period will be considered following an announced release candidate (RC). Patch versions (which are considered safe to update with) may have a significantly reduced developer release period.

The master branch will always contain an "_rc" postfix of the next intended version. The next "_rc" version may change at any time.

Developer release source code will not change once tagged.

If a bug is found in an announced developer release that is significant (such as a major feature is broken) then the release will be pulled. A patch version will be issued to replace it, depending on the severity of the patch an extended testing period may be announced. If the developer release version was never made public then the preceding patch version tag will be removed.

To receive developer notifications about release information, sign up to the newsletter on the OpenCart website - located in the footer. Then choose the developer news option.
